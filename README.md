# DD2440-Advanced-Algorithms-project
The group project for the course DD2440 Advanced Algorithms. The project focused on algorithms to approximate a Minimum Spanning Forest. 

In  ["Sublinear-time Algorithms"](https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/PTW/sublin.pdf), an algorithm is presented on how to approximate a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). This algorithm utilizes the edge weights in order to approximate the number of connected components, by iterating from 1 to max weight W − 1. We want to modify this to suit an approximation for a Minimum Spanning Forest (MSF). This is done by subtracting the number of trees in the forest times the maximum edge weights from the original MST formula. Thus eliminating the edges that should have connected the forest into an MST.
